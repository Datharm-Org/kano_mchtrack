      <p>As a non-profit organization, Medic Mobile (“Medic”)’s mission is to advance good health and human flourishing
        by building open source technology with and for hard-to-reach communities. We value humanity, creativity,
        initiative, solidarity, and openness. Being responsible stewards of people’s data is critically important to our
        mission.</p>
      <p>We use the concept of Responsible Data (RD) to outline our collective duty to prioritise and respond to the
        ethical, legal, social, and privacy-related challenges that come from using data in new and different ways in
        healthcare, advocacy, and social change. We have an obligation to account for unintended consequences of working
        with data by:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prioritising people’s rights to consent, privacy, security and ownership when using data in social change
          and advocacy efforts</li>
        <li>Implementing values and practices of transparency and openness</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As an organization, we promise to do our best to live up to these obligations. We promise to show initiative,
        to seek feedback, and to proactively seek out ways to work with data more responsibly. We promise to accompany
        patients, health workers, researchers, organizational partners, and our open source community in the journey
        from best intentions to best practices in data-driven projects. The purpose of Medic’s data policy is to help
        our organization deliver on this responsible data promise.</p>

      <p>Medic serves as a technical partner to governments and non-governmental organizations around the world. As a
        result, our projects comply with a range of country-specific and region-specific data protection regulations,
        and the details of compliance are addressed on a project-by-project basis. Adhering to all data regulations that
        are relevant to a given project is a central element of Medic’s global privacy and data protection policy.</p>
      <p>In most cases, the Ministries of Health, other government agencies, and non-governmental organizations that
        Medic supports (Medic “Partner(s)”) serve as data controlling entities, and they work with Medic as a business
        associate. Partners establish additional data handling policies and standard operating procedures, which are
        typically documented in Memoranda of Understanding or/and Data Sharing Agreements signed by these Partners as
        well as Medic.</p>

      <p>Medic has developed an open-source software toolkit (“Software”) that combines smart messaging, decision
        support, easy data gathering and management, and health system analytics. The Software can be accessed via many
        types of devices, including feature phones, smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Certain aspects of the
        Software can be downloaded for use on such end user devices. Health workers and families can use the Software to
        help monitor pregnancies, track outbreaks faster, treat illnesses, keep stock of essential medicines, and
        communicate about emergencies, among other things.</p>
      <p>The Software is made available to the public on a free and open source basis, under licenses approved by the
        Open Source Initiative. These licenses limit Medic’s liability or responsibility with respect to any uses of the
        Software in which Medic personnel are not directly involved in Processing Data (defined below). The Software
        source code and the relevant licenses can be accessed at <a
          href="http://github.com/medic">http://github.com/medic</a>.</p>
      <p>Medic hosts, maintains and supports certain components of the Software on Medic managed servers where Data
        obtained by use of Software on end user devices is received, accessed, handled, and/or stored (collectively,
        “Processed”). “Data” means any and all data, information and other content uploaded, posted, input or
        transmitted to the Software, or generated by the use of the Software, by or on behalf of End Users.</p>
      <p>Subject to compliance with applicable law, Medic and its permitted subcontractors and agents shall not disclose
        Data to any third party and shall not use or access the Data for any purpose, except the following specific
        purposes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To provide services or conduct activities as permitted in writing by a Partner acting as the data
          controlling entity for the specific Data being accessed or shared (which may require execution of a memorandum
          of understand or data use agreement);</li>
        <li>To maintain and improve the Software;</li>
        <li>To perform routine monitoring and public reporting on aggregated Impact Metrics (defined below).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For the purposes of this policy, “Impact Metrics” refers to aggregated Data which does not include personally
        identifiable information or Protected Health Information (defined below), and which is useful for Medic’s
        charitable purpose of monitoring the use of the Software and understanding its impacts on health systems.
        Examples of Impact Metrics include the total number of households registered in the Software, the total number
        of health workers using the Software, the total number of households visited in a given month, and the total
        number of Software-supported actions on antenatal care, postnatal care, integrated community case management,
        family planning, malnutrition, and immunization services. It may also include aggregate Data concerning COVID-19
        services such as community event-based surveillance, contact tracing, CHW self-checks, and support for
        self-isolation provided in Medic-supported projects.</p>
      <p>Any Impact Metrics shared with the general public will be aggregated globally; Medic personnel shall not
        de-aggregate the Impact Metrics to identify activities in any particular Country, without obtaining prior
        written consent from the Partner(s) acting as the relevant data controlling entities. Examples of previously
        reported Impact Metrics are available to the public in Medic’s quarterly and annual reports, which can be
        accessed at <a href="https://medic.org/reports/">https://medic.org/reports/</a>.</p>
      <p>All additional uses of data for research and reporting will comply with applicable Ministry of Health policies
        and existing Partner policies for health data access and sharing. Medic personnel shall not use any Data for
        research purposes unless Medic has obtained the prior written consent of the relevant Partner(s), which may
        involve execution of a data sharing agreement.</p>

      <p>For purposes of this policy, protected health information (“PHI”) is defined as any physically or
        electronically-encoded information containing at least one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>patient name(s);</li>
        <li>patient-related dates (including birth, registration, visit, death);</li>
        <li>patient-related ages;</li>
        <li>patient and/or family phone/fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and/or social media account names;</li>
        <li>references to a patient-related geographical subdivision (if smaller than 20,000 people);</li>
        <li>social security, tax identification, or other patient account numbers;</li>
        <li>patient-related device identifiers, addresses, or serial numbers (including IP addresses, MAC addresses,
          computer/-device serial numbers, beneficiary numbers, account numbers, and personally-identifying URLs);</li>
        <li>licensure information (including drivers’ license and license plate numbers, and numbers related to
          professional membership/licensing);</li>
        <li>images containing the face of a patient, patient’s family member, or any other patient-related contact;</li>
        <li>any biometric data describing a patient (including eye/hand measurements, height, weight, or clothing
          sizes); and</li>
        <li>any unique identifier or code, other than a study-specific unique identifier assigned for purposes of
          managing an approved research protocol</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Medic’s PHI policy requires that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Access to protected health information – and to devices containing protected health information – must be
          password protected.</li>
        <li>Any and all protected health information must be stored and retrieved using a full-disk encryption system.
        </li>
        <li>Any device that connects to or uses any of Medic’s mission-critical services must use a full-disk encryption
          system at all times.</li>
        <li>When communicating information electronically, any and all protected health information must be protected
          using a secure transfer system.</li>
        <li>Each person is responsible for his/her own compliance. If any person becomes aware of a violation of this
          policy, they have a duty to report the incident directly to Medic’s People Operations Manager, and/or COO.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>All Medic personnel sign a Protected Health Information (PHI) policy which mandates the use of full disk
        encryption, secure communication channels, and two factor authentication when handling PHI. This policy applies
        to all Medic personnel – including, but not limited to, employees, contractors, associates, fellows, interns,
        advisors, and board members.
        This policy applies to computer equipment and/or systems that are either: (i) property of Medic; (ii) property
        of any Medic personnel; or (iii) used directly by Medic personnel to carry out any assigned duties.</p>
      <p>Exceptions to this policy may be granted – on a task-specific or project-specific basis only – at the
        discretion of the CPO or COO. This policy does not confer any ownership of data; Partner-submitted data remains
        in the control of Partner organizations. This policy does not apply to equipment stored in an authorized secure
        data center / facility (e.g. Amazon Web Services), or to equipment wholly owned and operated by an external
        Partner, or to external software deployments to which Medic has no access.</p>

      <p><strong>Web app:</strong> Medic uses secure transfers over HTTPS for all communication between the browser and
        our web application, with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) and 4096-bit SHA-2 certificates by default. We use a
        non-standard port for SSH access to reduce our exposure to automated brute-force attacks and can configure the
        web app to accept only public key authentication for SSH connections. Access to the web application requires a
        password, and user access can be established to varying degrees using a role-based access control facility (e.g.
        full access, restricted access, data entry only, and data export only).</p>
      <p><strong>Data storage:</strong> Medic uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) with enforced two-factor authentication,
        HTTPS, and Identity and Access Management (IAM) for all hosted instances. We use IAM policies on AWS to restrict
        what any one individual Medic developer/administrator can do. Please see below for more information on AWS data
        security.</p>
      <p><strong>SMS:</strong> We train users to input data using simple SMS codes or freeform SMS. We use “plain text
        encoding” which means viewers can see the value but not know the context of the data. As an example: when health
        workers text P 3 Jane (“P” for pregnancy, “3” for number of weeks pregnant, name), Medic registers the
        pregnancy, creates a patient ID, calculates the expected delivery date, and schedules automated reminder
        messages. SMS is inherently insecure but we work with every partner on safety practices to reduce and minimize
        mishandling of data and transmission of protected health information.</p>
      <p><strong>Android phones:</strong> To secure the data, each device must be configured to use Full Disk Encryption
        and a Screen Lock.</p>
